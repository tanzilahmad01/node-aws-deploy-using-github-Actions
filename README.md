After successfully connecting github to remote server follow this commands
Step 1: Update Package Repositories
Run the following command to update your package repositories:

sudo apt update
Step 2: Install Node.js
Install Node.js using the following command:

sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
Step 3: Install Nginx
Install Nginx to act as a reverse proxy for your Node.js application:

sudo apt-get install -y nginx
Step 4: Install PM2
Install PM2 globally to manage your Node.js application:

sudo npm i -g pm2
Step 5: Configure Nginx
Navigate to the Nginx sites-available directory and open the default configuration file for editing:

cd /etc/nginx/sites-available
sudo nano default
Inside the Nginx configuration file, add the following block to configure the reverse proxy for your API:

location /api {
    rewrite ^\/api\/(.*)$ /api/$1 break;
    proxy_pass http://localhost:8000;
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
}
Step 6: Restart Nginx
After making changes to the Nginx configuration, restart Nginx to apply the changes:

sudo systemctl restart nginx
Step 7: Start Your Node.js Application with PM2
Navigate to your project directory and start your Node.js application using PM2. Replace server.js with the actual filename of your Node.js application:

cd /path/to/your/app
pm2 start server.js --name=apiserver
Step 8: Restart Your Node.js Application with PM2 (Optional)
If you need to restart your Node.js application managed by PM2, you can use the following command:

pm2 restart apiserver
These steps should help you set up a Node.js backend API with Nginx and PM2 on your Debian-based Linux system. Make sure to customize the paths and filenames according to your specific project.
